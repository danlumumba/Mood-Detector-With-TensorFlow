#  Facial Emotion Recognition for Mental Wellness Monitoring

##  Introduction

Emotional wellbeing plays a vital role in overall mental health, yet it remains difficult to monitor—especially in digital environments. With the rise of mobile mental wellness apps and AI-based virtual therapy, there is a growing need for systems that can detect and respond to human emotions in real-time.

Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) offers a non-intrusive and intuitive way to understand emotional states by analyzing facial expressions. Emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and neutrality can provide valuable insight into a user’s mental state. When integrated into wellness platforms, FER systems can personalize content, guide empathetic chatbot responses, and even trigger alerts when distress is detected.

This project builds an end-to-end FER system tailored for mental wellness applications, combining computer vision, deep learning, and ethical AI practices to deliver emotionally intelligent feedback in real-time.

##  Problem Statement

Most existing wellness platforms rely heavily on user-input text or static surveys, missing the valuable emotional cues found in facial expressions. Without emotion detection capabilities, these platforms struggle to:

- Adapt to a user's real-time emotional needs
- Detect early signs of mental health distress
- Deliver personalized and empathetic content

Traditional facial emotion recognition systems face several challenges:
-  **Bias**: Datasets may underrepresent certain emotions, ethnicities, or age groups.
-  **Generalization**: Models may not perform well under varying conditions (lighting, facial features, occlusions).
-  **Transparency**: Lack of explainability can reduce trust in AI systems used for mental health.

A new solution is needed—one that is **accurate, real-time, ethical, and explainable**.

##  Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to **develop and deploy a real-time facial emotion recognition system** that supports **mental wellness monitoring**, with the following goals:

-  Accurately detect key facial emotions (Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral)
-  Integrate with wellness apps to enhance emotional context and personalization
-  Visualize model decisions using explainability techniques like Grad-CAM
-  Build a lightweight, user-friendly web interface for emotion prediction
-  Deploy on free cloud platforms with prediction logging and monitoring
-  Ensure ethical handling of face data (anonymization, non-storage post-inference)
-  Address data imbalance and improve generalization across diverse faces and settings

This system aims to improve how wellness platforms understand and support their users, making emotional intelligence a built-in feature—not an afterthought.
